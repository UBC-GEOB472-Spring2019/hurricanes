Collaboration and reliance on other sources: 
I used one of the links provided to look for data in GitHub.com. The data I found the most interesting was about palm oil mills. When I did my peer critique I was deciding between using placeholders to search for mills in a specific country or rather using the placeholders to show the mills that had a special certification that ensures tehir practices are sustainable. After receiving feedback from one of my peers I opted to put a placeholder to show the mills with the country since I added code which gave each mill a different color whether they had the certificate or not; this is shown as blue for certified and orange for no certification. In making my map I relied in data found in GitHub and in the code we have used in class to add the placeholders. 

REFLECTIVE ANALYSIS:
I designed the map for people interested in knowing more about the sustinable management of palm oil mills in the geographical south, especially in developing countries. The maps attempts to highlight mills with RSPO Certification and those which are not certified to ensure consumers the palm oil extraction is done in a sustainable manner. My map is succesful by giving users the chance to search for certified mills in different countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia which have many mills to know which ones are sustainable and look at the colors of each point to get a sense of how many and where mills are operating without being accountable for sustainable extraction. My map could have been more succesful if I the data provided showed any other types of certifications besides sustainability instead of RSPO or none. 


To design the map I looked to tutorials and used mapbox to import the points and then convert them to a geoJSON file I could import to use Leaflet. I have to say I would have liked to keep the mapbox basemap because it is more clear but there were some issues with using the format and I chose to use leaflet. The interactivity of the maps deepens the understanding of the information portrayed by showcasing wether mills are certified as sustainable or not when it comes to extraction, which is very important nowadays with climate change. I used the basemap from leaflet showing the land use with green, mountain ranges and dessert to add to a better understanding of the areas where we see mills. My map could be improved if I added data about the impacts os unsustainable palm oil extraction which I believe would strengthen the case for mills to obtain the certification.
