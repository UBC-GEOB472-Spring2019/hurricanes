Collaboration and reliance on other sources: 
I used one of the links provided to look for data in GitHub.com. The data I found the most interesting was about palm oil mills. When I did my peer critique I was deciding between using placeholders to search for mills in a specific country or rather using the placeholders to show the mills that had a special certification that ensures tehir practices are sustainable. After receiving feedback from one of my peers I opted to put a placeholder to show the mills with the certificate since the map base would help the map user infer which country the mill is located in. In making my map I relied in data found in GitHub and in the code we have used in class to add the placeholders. 

REFLECTIVE ANALYSIS:
I designed the map for people interested in knowing more about the sustinable management of palm oil mills in the geographical south, especially in developing countries. The maps attempts to highlight mills with RSPO Certification which aims to ensure consumers the palm oil extraction is done in a sustainable manner. My map is succesful by giving users the chance to search for certified mills by typing RSPO Certified to know which ones are sustainable or typing None to get a sense of how many and where mills are operating without being accountable for sustainable extraction. My map could have been more succesful if I the data provided showed any other types of certifications besides sustainability instead of RSPO or none. To design the map I looked to tutorials and used mapbox to import the points and then convert them to a geoJSON file I could import to use Leaflet. I have to say I would have liked to keep the mapbox basemap because it is more clear but there were some issues with using the format and it was not possible to do it. 
The interactivity of the maps deepend the understanding of the information portrayed by showcasing wether mills are certified as sustainable or not when it comes to extraction, which is very important nowadays with climate change. 
Who did you design your map for? What questions or needs does the map attempt to raise or address? In what respects is your map successful and unsuccessful in this?
What process did you follow in the design/iteration of the map? 
How does your map incorporate interactivity in a way that adds understanding? 
What are the intellectual justifications for your choices of data and cartographic stylings?
In what ways could your map be improved? 
Making reference to relevant cartographic/interaction principles you've learned in readings will improve your work.
