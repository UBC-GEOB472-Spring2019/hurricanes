Collaboration and reliance on other sources: 
I used one of the links provided to look for data in GitHub.com. The data I found the most interesting was about palm oil mills. When I did my peer critique I was deciding between using placeholders to search for mills in a specific country or rather using the placeholders to show the mills that had a special certification that ensures tehir practices are sustainable. After receiving feedback from one of my peers I opted to put a placeholder to show the mills with the certificate since the map base would help the map user infer which country the mill is located in. In making my map I relied in data found in GitHub and in the code we have used in class to add the placeholders. 

REFLECTIVE ANALYSIS:
I designed 
Who did you design your map for? What questions or needs does the map attempt to raise or address? In what respects is your map successful and unsuccessful in this?
What process did you follow in the design/iteration of the map? 
How does your map incorporate interactivity in a way that adds understanding? 
What are the intellectual justifications for your choices of data and cartographic stylings?
In what ways could your map be improved? 
Making reference to relevant cartographic/interaction principles you've learned in readings will improve your work.
