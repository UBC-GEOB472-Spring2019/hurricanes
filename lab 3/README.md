Collaborations and reliance on other resources: Please document any so I know what you have been able to find and what you have added. What did you learn from a peer visualization critique, if you did one? What did you contribute to others? What coding resources (and individuals) did you draw upon in the process of making your map, and to what effect? (Commenting in the code itself at the places in question is helpful.) 
Reflective analysis: A several-paragraph (2-3 paragraphs, revised with care; not essay-length) piece that gives the reader a discussion of the decisions that you made and the resulting insights that you think your 3D/immersive visualization conveying. Some possibilities:
Who did you design your visualization for? What questions or needs does the visualization attempt to raise or address? In what respects is your visualization successful and unsuccessful in this?
What process did you follow in the design/iteration of the visualization? 
How does your visualization engage immersive/3D dimensions in a way that differs from what is possible in 2D and adds understanding? 
What are the intellectual justifications for your choices of data and cartographic stylings?
In what ways could your visualization be improved? 
Making reference to relevant immersive visualization principles you've learned in readings will improve your work.
