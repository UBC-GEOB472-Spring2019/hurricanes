I wanted to make my visualization interactive, for this I asked the prof how I could make the text appear when the user focuses the camera to it. To accomplish this I looked at the operations in A-frame and used the event_set component to make the fun facts about domestic animals appear when the camera was set on each animal. I used the library from the tutorials in A-frame to find the animals in 3D to add to the visualization as well as a background that would resemble a farm. From a peer visualization I chose to add a backgorund to the text to make it more readable and changed the position of the text for users to visualzie them more clearly. At the begining I was going to use the same code we used for one of the activities to make the text disappear. After talking to the prof, he pointed out there was a command in a-frame to do this and after finding it I decided to use that one instead. The visuaklization is more interactive than geographical, alhtough I did use principles of visual hierarchy to ensure the text and the animals being displayes were relatively accurate in size and easily seen. 

My visualization is design thinking of kids wanting to learn fun facts about domestic animals, especially those who are the most appealing such as dogs, horses and cows. The visualization aims to address questions regarding fun characteristics about the animals, I chose to use 3D models of the animals in low poly format to make them charicature like and more appealign to kids who are usually attracted to formats that resemble that of characters from animated series. My animation is succesful in that it provides the user with the information of each animal when the camera is focus on one of them rather than having all the information being displayed at once. I believe my visualization could have been more succesful if the animal and the text could have been automatically zoomed in when the camera focuses on them to get a better visualization. To design the visualization I first downloaded the photosphere and the 3D models of the animals form Sketchfab. Later I used the inspect function in teh visualziation to position the animals at different locations to avoid them from overlkappign and to have space for the text to be displayed. Once the position and the text were ready I decided to put a backgorund to the text to visualize them more clearly. I used the event_component in  A-frame for the text to be displayed only when the camera hovers over the animal. In 2D the animals and the text would be visualized all at once and the user would not have the possibility to explore the surroundings. The 3D component adds understanding as it gives the user the power to choose what to see or not, in terms of the fun facts, and to move along 360 degrees to visualize each animal. My visualization could be improved by adding sounds to the animals to make it even more interactive and perhaps even adding more animals. 

The visualization provides a new human experience as users can look around in the VR to look for the different animals placed in different sections of the photosphere and interact with them by knowing fun facts about them. The format is portable which makes it more appealing as lower levels of realism were accepted int he past due to the lack of portability (e.g. families gathered in front of the TV now can use VR sets to see different environments in 3D. One of the potential issues with VR is making the user have undesired reactions such as nausea or having the images showing pixels. This is an important consideration and after showing the final output to some of my peers I believe this issues do not apply. However, the 3D models of the animals are low poly and may seem liek pixels but this choice was on purpose to make it more appealign to kids.
