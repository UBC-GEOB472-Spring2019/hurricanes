I wnated to make my visualization interactive, for this I asked the prof how I could make the text appear when the user focuses the camera to it. To accomplish this I looked at the operations in A-frame and used the event_set component to make the fun facts about domestic animals appear when the camera was set on each animal. I used the library from the tutorials in A-frame to find the animals in 3D to add to the visualization as well as a background that would resemble a farm. From a peer visualization I chose to add a backgorund to the text to make it more readable and changed the position of the text for users to visualzie them more clearly. At the begining I was going to use the same code we used for one of the activities to make the text disappear. After talking to the prof, he pointed out there was a command in a-frame to do this and after finding it I decided to use that one instead. The visuaklization is more interactive than geographical, alhtough I did use principles of visual hierarchy to ensure the text and the animals being displayes were relatively accurate in size and easily seen. 

Reflective analysis: A several-paragraph (2-3 paragraphs, revised with care; not essay-length) piece that gives the reader a discussion of the decisions that you made and the resulting insights that you think your 3D/immersive visualization conveying. Some possibilities:
Who did you design your visualization for? What questions or needs does the visualization attempt to raise or address? In what respects is your visualization successful and unsuccessful in this?
What process did you follow in the design/iteration of the visualization? 
How does your visualization engage immersive/3D dimensions in a way that differs from what is possible in 2D and adds understanding? 
What are the intellectual justifications for your choices of data and cartographic stylings?
In what ways could your visualization be improved? 
Making reference to relevant immersive visualization principles you've learned in readings will improve your work.
