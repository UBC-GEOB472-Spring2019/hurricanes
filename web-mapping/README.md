REFLECTIVE ANALYSIS
My map was designed for nature enthusiasts, local or from abroad, who want to enjoy from beautiful sceneries surrounded by different ecosystems. The map addresses questions of location, as the protected areas stand out from the map. Furthermore, the map provides a brief description of what visitors can expect to see when visiting the parks, forests or reserves and some historical background. The road system is provided as well as the name of town and cities nearby for context and for visitors to have a rough idea of how close they are to their destination. You can also see the mountain located within the natural destinations as some of them are home to mountains of special characteristics.

I chose a styling which shows land use, emphasizing the areas where the national parks, reserves and forests are located. I also added main roads and rivers, for context and to show the connection some of the locations have with water bodies. The overall visual/intellectual effect I was seeking with my map was to draw attention to the multiple protected areas in small yet megadiverse country as Ecuador. I believe the contrast and interactivity offered by the map achieve this objective. 

To have the map work at more than one zoom level I use the code from one of the practice exercises in map box to guide me. The zoom feature is not as relevant to the map user unless they want to get a rough idea of how to get to the location and the extent of the location itself. My map could be improved by fitting the information from each location in the area rather than extending beyond, where it can’t be read unless we zoom out. I did my best to edit the text to fit, some of them didn’t after the edits. Furthermore, I could have created a layer with paths some key cities to the location, although time consuming it could be useful to enhance the utility of the map. Having a legend could help identify key areas explicitly. The areas are highlighted thanks to the contrast in colors between regular land and the locations (national parks, ecological reserves, etc.). Having a map of the vegetation (i.e. agricultural, urban) could provide further context to the importance of the location to preserve different ecosystems. I did search for layers with this information, but I was unable to download them. I successfully download them to ArcMap but once I use the tool to convert to GeogJSON file I didn’t succeed. I changed the coordinates of the map to start but it did not work for centering the map toshow all the points, you need to move it to the right to see the Galapagos National Park. 

MAP CRITIQUE SESSION AND COLLABORATION
I worked on my own for this lab. However, my neighbour at te computer next to me offered me useful comments on what to include in the map. One of the toughest decisions was what to eliminate from the template offered by map box. I started with a basic style but then switched to the outdors style which provided more information relevant to the type of map I deisgned which is of naturla reserves. It was also very helpful for her to recommend to add intercativity beyond just the name of the location but rather a brief descrption to add more context to the map for users to have a better idea of what they'll find there.
